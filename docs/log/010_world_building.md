# World building

The book takes the approach of building the world as an X-Y grid.

But I think I want to try making the world a graph of connected locations.

So I tried that. And I think I would have succeeded.

But I'm *really* sick with COVID right now.

So then I fell back on implementing the tiles as the book envisioned.

At this point the player can navigate around the map.

```shell
$ python3 ./game.py
Escape from the Disquieting Cavern!
