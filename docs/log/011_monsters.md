# 011 Monsters

Ah, the inevitability of violence. I'll do something about this trope later. For now, still following along the book.

I just can't bring myself to make a different class for each kind of monster, rather than a single monster class that has fields for all the stats. Instantiation is a thing.

Added a Monster class.

Added a RandomMonsterTile.

Added 'a' action to attack the monster on the current tile.
