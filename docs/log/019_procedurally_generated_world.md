# 019 Procedurally generated world

Okay, one thing I want for this game is for the game world to be
procedurally generated.

Let's start easy. Let's say the world is a 10x10 grid of tiles.

I'd want a couple villages, a road between them, and forests the rest.

So, first thing we need to do is to be able to view the map.

This way it's feasible to see how well the procedural generator did.

Okay, so then add a couple villages, a road between them,
and fill the rest with forest.

Okay, that's pretty good. Enough for tonight.
