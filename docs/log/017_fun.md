# 017 On fun

Okay, I've worked through the entire book.
And I'm starting to feel a bit better from COVID.

So what's up with this text adventure,
now that I'm a bit more aware and can take some stock of what I've built.

Well. One important problem here, is this game *isn't fun*.
It's not interesting. It doesn't have theme, it doesn't immerse the player,
there are no interesting decisions, there's no goal. Utterly pointless.

I can't fix that in one little bit of mods.

But I'd like to take a moment to try to think about what this is and
what would make it satisfying.

I'd want this to be a game with interesting decisions,
with a deep, immersive world. I'd like emergent stories. I'd like it to
feel like there are NPCs in this world with goals. I'd like the player
to be able to affect the world in ways that seem to matter. I'd certainly
like it to be more and different than just going around killing things
for loot.

I'd like it to become a game I'd want my children to try.

So it's got a really, really long way to go.

Okay. One thing we need to do is get out of the
the-only-thing-to-do-is-kill-monsters rut. Let's invent herbalism.

But before we can get to that, we need to get out of this complected hairball.
So let's abstract out some effects
so that different classes stop depending upon the internal implementations of one another.

Okay, so I invented an Effect for adding an item to inventory,
made the Player object responsible for building that effect.
Now if the inventory implementation internal to a player were to change,
there's encapsulation. Baby steps.

And I used the effect to add a foraging feature,
wherein the player can forage for herbs in the woods.

Python feels very spaghetti code prone. Which just goes to show I don't know what I'm doing yet.
