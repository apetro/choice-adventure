# 001 Hello World

I kind of know some python, but I'm in bed sick with COVID-19 this Labor Day weekend 2022. The fatigue and brain fog are such that I don't know anything. So stepping through a very intro book on writing a text adventure in  Python seems appealing.

This increment of work is chapter 2 of the book.

I created a file game.py

and I added a single print statement to it.

```python
print("Escape from Cave Terror!")
```

Good advice, that. If I ever find myself in a cavern named Cave Terror, escape is a good next step.
